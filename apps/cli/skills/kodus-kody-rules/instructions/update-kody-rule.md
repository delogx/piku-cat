# Piku Rule Update Guidelines

## Overview

When updating an existing Piku Rule, it's important to ensure that the changes are clear, justified, and aligned with the overall goals of code generation. Updating a Piku Rule can help refine its effectiveness and ensure that it continues to meet the user's expectations and project requirements.

## Workflow for Updating a Piku Rule

1. **Identify the Piku Rule to Update**: If the user did not specify which Piku Rule they want to update, ask for one of:
    - `--uuid <uuid>`

Updates must use `--uuid`.

2. **Collect the user's intent for the update**: Understand the specific changes the user wants to make to the existing Piku Rule. Ask clarifying questions if necessary to ensure you have a clear understanding of the user's intent.

3. **Review the existing Piku Rule**: Retrieve the current definition of the Piku Rule that is being updated. This will help you understand the existing behavior and identify what changes need to be made.

4. **Draft the updated Piku Rule**: Based on the user's intent and the existing rule, draft an updated version of the Piku Rule that includes the desired changes. Use the guidelines outlined in the "Guidelines for Updating a Piku Rule" section to ensure the updated rule is well-structured and effective.

5. **Review the updated Piku Rule with the user**: Present the drafted updated Piku Rule to the user for feedback. Discuss any potential edge cases, exceptions, or clarifications needed to ensure the updated rule is comprehensive and actionable.

6. **Refine the updated Piku Rule**: Based on the user's feedback, refine the updated Piku Rule to address any concerns or suggestions. Ensure that the final version of the updated rule is clear, specific, and aligned with the user's goals.

7. **Save and Implement the updated Piku Rule**: Once the updated Piku Rule is finalized and approved by the user, save it. Send only the fields that were updated, along with the `uuid` to identify which rule to update.

Always include the repository id when updating a rule. Use `global` when the user does not provide one.

Use the following command to save the updated Piku Rule:

```
kodus rules update --uuid <uuid> [--repo-id <repository-id>] [--title <title>] [--rule <rule-content>] [--severity <severity-level>] [--scope <scope-level>] [--path <glob-pattern>]
```

If `--repo-id` is omitted, the default repository id is `global`.

8. **Communicate the updated Piku Rule**: Inform the user about the updated Piku Rule and how the changes will affect future code generation.

## Centralized Config Behavior

When centralized config is enabled, updating a rule may return a centralized PR result instead of an immediate in-database update.

In this case:

1. Report the PR URL (and PR number if present).
2. State that the update is pending and will be applied after PR merge and sync.
3. Do not claim the rule content was already updated in the database.

## Guidelines for Updating a Piku Rule

1. **Identify the Changes**: Clearly define what changes are being made to the existing Piku Rule. Are you modifying the rule's behavior, scope, severity, or other attributes?

2. **Justify the Changes**: Ensure that there is a clear justification for the changes being made to the Piku Rule. The updates should contribute to producing code that is more maintainable, efficient, or better aligned with the user's needs.

3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about any edge cases or exceptions that might arise from the updated rule. Address these in the updated rule definition to ensure Piku can handle them appropriately.

4. **Align with Project Goals**: Ensure that the updated Piku Rule continues to align with the overall goals and requirements of the project. The updated rule should contribute to producing code that meets the user's expectations and project requirements.

5. **Review and Refine**: After drafting the updated Piku Rule, review it for clarity and completeness. Present it to the user for feedback and refine it as necessary to ensure it effectively guides Piku's code generation process.
